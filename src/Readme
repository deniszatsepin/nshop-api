All Octopus modules (oct-module) are store here. 
Every module's folders must be named like oct-'module name'.

The following files are all required:
  1.  package.json
  2.  index.js
  3.  Readme

The following files are optional:
  1.  init.js
  2.  api.js
  3.  rest.js

If the init.js and rest.js files are exist, they load at startup.
